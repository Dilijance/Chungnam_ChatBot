*  나의 첫 깃허브
    * Test

AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning etc..
* Learning Process
    * learn by TESTING cases
    * test through TEST cases

* Torch
    * Tensor
        * Batch_size: Controlling size of an output tensor(Torch5)
        * Shuffle True/False: Random order of data(Torch5)
        * %DType=int(8-64): No idea what is it%

```python
#Class creating & most useful def's
class Test:
    def __init__(self):
        pass
    
    def __len__(self):
        pass

    def __getitem__ (self)
        pass


#text.csv files can be read by pandas
import pandas as pd
import torch

#By Datasets & pandas you can get access and sort data from csv files
from torch.utils.data import Dataset
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

#Numpy quite similar with Tensor data type
import numpy as np

#Re-make array into Tensor
import torchvision.transforms as transforms

# # MNIST most actively using DATASET

#Get something through internet by URL
import requests

#Data visualizer (seems like the most fun)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```
